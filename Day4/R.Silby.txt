ANOVA 
BAYES can test the significance of anova. 

Parameter values that perform well have a normal distribution.

PARAMETER ESTIMATION:
1. define prior distributions. Probability of parameter value x . A distribution and std

2. run model selecting n random samples from prior

3. accept n best fitting models

4. examine posterior distribution from each n best fitting models

GOODNESS OF FIT:
least squares between observed data and modelled data
	
	for o,m in observed, model
		cost = square differences o,m

sum of costs = model fit

We must weight parameters if they are different. 
		Weighting parameters? is this normalisation?
		Normalisation is a potential 0-1. The issue can be if you have parameters with vastly different means and std. Experiment . 
		
Bayesian's = standard error = credibility interval.

Can include the standard deviation as a parameter to test the uncertainty of the underlying data set. 
Ie if you are aware that your data is limited to a narrow range of years for ex.

Parameter Correlation:
Narrowing posterior distributions indicate better fit. 
If there is a direct relationship between parameter pairs; this may be misleading in thinking that parameters are not causal if they do not narrow. 
HOWEVER if pairs of correlations exists, a parameter which narrows the posterior and one which does not, if they are correlated perhaps these are both important.
IF correlated, remove one of them and test. Either could be responsible. Discuss correlation, is it causality?

Bayes Factor Table?
Ratio of model success : model failure
1-20 = positive evidence
