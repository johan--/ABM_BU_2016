Richard Stillman:

Why? decision making within ABM can be limited by avaliable data.
For example how can we say that climate change will occur beyond observed records?

How do parameters affect the results of each model?
Rather than looking at entire populations, we think of the individual and range of behaviours. 

Agent Based and IBM book. 

Developing, keep model as general as possible. Specificity causes issues.

Define relationships between input/output = response.
For example birds feeding rate and energy gain 
As the size of birds increases, the rate at which it consumes increase linearly, yet energy expended increases squared.

	Of all models applied, this demonstrated is the best representation of observational data.
